# Midland-hospital API
Restful API for Hospital Staff Data

A hospital is planning to migrate their locally available data and medical records into an API service. The
API service is available internally to all staff, and for official use only

The API Postman Collection can be seen below:

The dummy data was created using:
https://www.mockaroo.com/

Things to Note
    1. The API uses an embedded database h2, and so no database setup is required.
    2. The Random data import is executed using Spring Data SQL
    3. All API endpoints except /api/v1/staffs/create (createStaff), and /api/v1/staffs (fetchStafs) require UUID to be generated and passed to the header before the resource can be accessed
    4. The UUID is generated by creating a staff and passing the uuid returned to the collection variable

Things that would have been done if there was time
    1. I would have implemented caching for the patient records
